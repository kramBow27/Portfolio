                    Hello, nice to meet you, my name is Henrique Luna, I am a full-stack developer and, although I am
                    still in academic training, I already have experience working with a variety of technologies. I am
                    accustomed to readjustments that imply changes in the work environment or in the tools used, because
                    above all, I always seek to develop my logic and decision-making skills.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Currently, I am interning at the company CEBI and working as a full-stack developer on a foreign
                    project. In this project, I have been the only active developer for almost a year. (See project
                    details below.)

                    I am also pursuing bachelors in Computer Science and Mathematics. I really like to keep myself
                    updated and, regardless of the circumstances, I am also in constant learning.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    My main goal is to contribute, with everything I have to offer, to the technological development of
                    our civilization. I believe that the real impact of technology is directly on the way we live and
                    interact with the world.

                    You will find more details about the stack I work with in the section below.

                <p class="presentation-text">
                    Henrique has been great to work with. Simply put he is extremely hard working, able to problem solve
                    complex problems,
                    thinks with the end user in mind, fantastic with communication in English.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Through our interactions, he has been very studious, quickly learning on his own initiative and is
                    self-motivated to learn as much as he can. We managed to release product improvements at a rate 40%
                    faster than other engineers hired.
                    <br /><br />
                    His code is clean and gets things done quickly. He has a fantastic eye for understanding the
                    end-user experience and proactively offers thoughtful contributions. Henrique's English is great and
                    very fluent at this point.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I would strongly recommend Henrique and believe that anyone who hires him will find someone who will
                    be a great addition for many years to come!

                <p class="postsheetmodal">
                    PostSheet is a North American web application built in a node.js environment with TypeScript,
                    rendering
                    with EJS. It simply enables the sending of emails through data templates. The application obtains
                    information from tables (.CSV, .XLS, GoogleSheets, Airtable, .XLSX), bringing an identifier from the
                    first row of the table and associating the data from the other rows to their respective columns.
                    <br /><br />
                    Finally, this data can be used to construct personalized emails according to the data obtained in
                    the
                    tables related to each recipient.
                    <br /><br />
                    PostSheet is a project that has been developed by a series of full-stack developers, but never more
                    than
                    one at a time. Currently, I am the fourth developer to work on the project but the one who has
                    worked
                    the longest.
                    <br /><br />
                    The application is used by some renowned institutions like "The City University of New York" and
                    "Stanford University" and is still under development. The latest implementations carried out by me
                    were:
                    - Allowing .CSV and .XLS as data sources for campaign creation
                    - Stripe integration for user redirection to the portal
                    - Front-end modifications/adjustments
                    <br /><br />
                    Several bug fixes were also made that had been left in previous versions. Due to the current
                    priority to
                    meet deadlines for the release of new features, I chose not to change the stack. However, a
                    migration
                    from front-end EJS to React is being carried out in parallel, which will also necessitate the
                    creation
                    of a new back-end since EJS is a server-side-rendering technology and React is client-side.
                    <br /><br />
                    Even if we had adopted the approach of "React Server-Side Rendering", substantial changes would
                    still
                    have to be made in the back-end anyway. Therefore, seizing the opportunity, we will restructure the
                    entire project so that future implementation of features involving complex data-analysis functions
                    does
                    not become exhausting and complicated.

                    sent
                    by a friend. Initially, the idea was to just study React and Styled Components, but I ended up
                    opting
                    to start building
                    a full-stack application, whose goal will be to allow users to create personalized quizzes, connect
                    with
                    their friends,
                    share, debate, and have fun.

                    <br />

                    Young people will be able to create fun quizzes with their
                    friends, and adults can share knowledge while the more politicized
                    can invest their time arguing in defense of their opinions.
                    For now, the application is still in the initial stages of development, but it already has a
                    pre-configured
                    and functional full-stack structure.

                <h2>CEBI - Industrial Banking Electronic Center (Full Stack .NET/Angular)</h2>

                Currently interning at CEBI, a company that provides integrated system services for public agencies,
                I have implemented various features that are already in a production environment and being used by
                clients
                (mostly municipal governments in the interior of the state of São Paulo).
                At CEBI, we work as a team and organize schedules through the Scrum methodology, where tasks are
                updated every 15 days.
                <b>The main stack used is:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>-C# with .NET Framework</li>
                    <li>-Git</li>
                    <li>-Angular.js</li>
                    <li>-Oracle Database</li>
                    <li>-Android Studio (Java)</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <br />
                I have actively participated in over 50 implementations, all of which were successful and completed on
                time.
                <b>Among them, I can mention:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Creation of APIs for HTTP calls (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE);</li>
                    <li>- Homologation of the work order generation application for Android 13;</li>
                    <li>- Interactions with the database and execution of SQL commands;</li>
                    <li>- Creation of new entities and their respective mapping with the database;</li>
                    <li>- Implementation of features for sending GPS coordinates and displaying them on the map;</li>
                    <li>- Creation of new menus and sections in systems;</li>
                    <li>- Creation of queries for generating new reports;</li>
                    <li>- Error handling (both on the server and client);</li>
                    <li>- Implementation of methods for executing procedures in PL/SQL;</li>
                    <li>- Creation of new filters for queries, all generated by dynamic fields;</li>
                    <li>- Bug fixes;</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <br />
                At CEBI, I have learned (and continue to learn) a lot through the cooperation of my more experienced
                colleagues, so much so that
                I have been granted enough trust to work as the only .NET and Java(Android) developer on the team that
                handles
                customer service and work order management systems.

                    The goal of this portfolio is to be practical and informative. To lead the recruiter to my projects
                    in a simple way. I tried to emphasize the information and projects that demonstrate my actual
                    skills.

                    If you received this portfolio, know that I highly value your company, as I am currently looking to
                    establish myself in a place where I can see a greater and more noble objective than just being paid.
                    Working with technology is building the future, and that is priceless.
